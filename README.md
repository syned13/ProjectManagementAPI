# ProjectManagementAPI
REST API for an app that allows creation of projects and assign employees to it.

This was made as a final project for the database course in the Pontificia Universidad Catolica Madre y Maestra(PUCMM),
in my exchange semester through the National Exchange Program(MOVENI).

## Installation

Clone the project

``` git clone https://github.com/syned13/ProjectManagementAPI.git```

Create a .env file with a variable ```DB_CONNECTION```, a connection string to a Postgres database.

## Usage

Run run.py file
```python3 run.py```
